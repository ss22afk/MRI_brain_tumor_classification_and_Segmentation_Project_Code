# MRI_brain_tumor_classification_and_Segmentation_Project_Code
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN, R-CNN, VGG-16) to classify and segment brain tumours from MRI scans. Built as part of my MSc Data Science dissertation at the University of Hertfordshire.

## Models Used
- CNN (Custom)
- R-CNN (ResNet-50 base)
- VGG-16 (Pre-trained)

## Dataset
Publicly available from [Kaggle - Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)

## Tools & Libraries
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab

## Project Structure
- `/models` includes all training scripts for CNN, R-CNN, and VGG-16
- `/utils` contains preprocessing and training utility modules

## Results Summary
- VGG-16 achieved best performance with 85.9% validation accuracy
- Full performance metrics are documented in the report
